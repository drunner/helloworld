# This file is run on the host, and backs up any configuration
# or data stored outside /config.
#
# Examples are database backups etc (which we might want to
# stop any running services to do).
#
# Backups need to be stored in BACKUPPATH. We can use whatever
# format we want for the files, we restore them in the restore
# script.
